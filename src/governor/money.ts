/**
 * Money is handled as integer minor units throughout the governor.
 *
 * Prava's CLI and REST API both take and return decimal *strings* ("8.50"),
 * never floats — so we parse to integer cents at the boundary, do all
 * comparison and subtraction in integers, and format back to a string only
 * when handing a value to Prava or to a human.
 *
 * Scope: two-decimal currencies only. Zero-decimal (JPY, KRW) and
 * three-decimal (BHD, KWD) currencies are rejected rather than silently
 * mis-scaled — a spend governor that quietly multiplies a cap by 100 is worse
 * than one that refuses the charge.
